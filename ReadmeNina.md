Hi everyone, my name is Nina and this is my project for app dev!.
____________________________________
These are the changes I have made:
    I added a new file that is a RaspberryPi Python library for the RC522 rfid reader,

    I replaced the entire original code to write with a completely new code. The new code will confirm successful (or unsuccessful) writing content onto RFID card.

    I added code to add a feature that prompts you to name the RFID tag before writing on it.
